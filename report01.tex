Nowadays, there are many types of automated guided vehicle (AGV) running in different field of industries. Typically their job is moving raw materials or parts around the manufacturing facility. And they can be very accurate in working by following the guide from the wires in the floor, magnets, laser, or vision. However, they all requires an indoor condition. Therefore, the purpose of this thesis report is to discuss the implement of the outdoor AGV. An outdoor AGV has much more constrains than indoor. The environment indoor can be easily controlled while the door is not. The condition could be rough ground, no preset guiding wire or magnets, vision blocking by dust, and so on. The solution, which will talk in this paper, to achieve the outdoor AGV is using laser or vision to guide. In addition, a buffer will be set to stabilize the cargo or others working devices, to prevent them from the shaking due to the rough ground. To be more specific, a prototype will be built to simulate the working of seeder. In agriculture, it is very important to plant corns in a straight line. It benefits not only in absorbing sunlight and ventilation, but also reduce the work of irrigation, fertilizing, and harvest. Because a straight line of corn also mean a straight line of aisle. And more importantly, to achieve unmanned agriculture, a corn field with straight line of aisle will be a good condition for other agriculture robots.

AGV解放了很多劳动力，节省成本，提高效率。室内的做的很好，精准度很高（1 引用室内AGV）但是室外的略显不足。室外的环境条件复杂，地面不平，打滑，天气，铺设轨道不划算。本文将探讨一种新的设计方案，试图解决。
主要针对现在的农业育种实验田，以及将来的无人农场，所设计的，户外AGV。

介绍重要性
就现在的农业育种试验田来说，播种的直非常重要
控制变量法，种的直可以有效地保证不同植株在相同的条件下生长（2 引用试验田需要条件）。光照，二氧化碳，肥料，水分。一切都已种的直为前提。
未来的无人农业，种的直则无人机器人更方便进入垄间工作（3 引用农业机器人），提高无人机器人的精准性，保护作物不被破坏。

介绍传统农业和未来的无人农业的区别。美国的农业已经完善，形成了独有的农业形式，粗放型。地多，人少，资源多。土地浪费（4 引用大农场的圆形灌溉）（  图片农场俯视图），不是不能节约，而是现状成本低。但是像对于世界的其他地方，沙漠国家需要精准的滴管（5 引用滴灌），因为缺水。中国人多，人均地少（6 引用人均耕地），要更高效的利用土地，提高单位土地产量。（做图表 中美人均耕地比较，做图表，中国人均耕地和耕地产粮）发展未来精准农业不像在美国看起来那样不重要。

为实现第一步，在现有农机上进行改装，增加缓冲装置（特点），以提高精确度。制作模型进行试验。使用树莓派来对摄像头采集的图像进行处理，从而引导农机走直线。同时利用步进马达进行微调整，应付突发情况和误差。比如突然被石头搬到，突然打滑，农机突然偏离路径，无法马上回归，此时用带有步进马达的缓冲装置进行补救。而且农机很大，进行厘米级的移动困难而且耗费时间，有了缓冲装置可以减少很多误差。
